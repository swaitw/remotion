## Import audio

[Put an audio file into the `public/` folder](/docs/assets) and use [`staticFile()`](/docs/staticfile) to reference it.  
Add an [`<Audio/>`](/docs/audio) tag to your component to add sound to it.

```tsx twoslash
import { AbsoluteFill, Audio, staticFile } from "remotion";

export const MyComposition = () => {
  return (
    <AbsoluteFill>
      <Audio src={staticFile("audio.mp3")} />
    </AbsoluteFill>
  );
};
```

You can also add remote audio by passing a URL:

```tsx twoslash
import { AbsoluteFill, Audio } from "remotion";

export const MyComposition = () => {
  return (
    <AbsoluteFill>
      <Audio src="https://example.com/audio.mp3" />
    </AbsoluteFill>
  );
};
```

By default, the audio will play from the start, at full volume and full length.
You can mix multiple tracks together by adding more audio tags.

## Cutting or trimming the audio

The `<Audio />` tag supports the `startFrom` and `endAt` props. In the following example, we assume that the [`fps`](/docs/composition#fps) of the composition is `30`.

```tsx twoslash {6}
import { AbsoluteFill, Audio, staticFile } from "remotion";

export const MyComposition = () => {
  return (
    <AbsoluteFill>
      <Audio src={staticFile("audio.mp3")} startFrom={60} endAt={120} />
    </AbsoluteFill>
  );
};
```

By passing `startFrom={60}`, the playback starts immediately, but with the first 2 seconds of the audio trimmed away.  
By passing `endAt={120}`, any audio after the 4 second mark in the file will be trimmed away.

The audio will play the range from `00:02:00` to `00:04:00`, meaning the audio will play for 2 seconds.

## Delaying audio

Use a `<Sequence>` with a positive `from` value to delay the audio from playing.
In the following example, the audio will start playing (from the beginning) after 100 frames.

```tsx twoslash {6-8}
import { AbsoluteFill, Audio, Sequence, staticFile } from "remotion";

export const MyComposition = () => {
  return (
    <AbsoluteFill>
      <Sequence from={100}>
        <Audio src={staticFile("audio.mp3")} />
      </Sequence>
    </AbsoluteFill>
  );
};
```

## Controlling volume

You can use the [`volume`](/docs/audio#volume) prop to control the volume.

The simplest way is to pass a number between 0 and 1. `1` is the maximum volume and `0` mutes the audio.

```tsx twoslash {8}
import { Audio } from "remotion";
import audio from "./audio.mp3";

export const MyComposition = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <div>Hello World!</div>
      <Audio src={audio} volume={0.5} />
    </div>
  );
};
```

You can also change volume over time by passing in a function that takes a frame number and returns the volume.

```tsx twoslash {8-10}
import { AbsoluteFill, Audio, interpolate, staticFile } from "remotion";

export const MyComposition = () => {
  return (
    <AbsoluteFill>
      <Audio
        src={staticFile("audio.mp3")}
        volume={(f) =>
          interpolate(f, [0, 30], [0, 1], { extrapolateLeft: "clamp" })
        }
      />
    </AbsoluteFill>
  );
};
```

In this example we are using the [interpolate()](/docs/interpolate) function to fade the audio in over 30 frames. Note that because values below 0 are not allowed, we need to set the `extrapolateLeft: 'clamp'` option to ensure no negative values.

Inside the callback function, the first frame at which audio is being played is numbered `0`, regardless of the value of `useCurrentFrame()`.

Prefer using a callback function if the volume is changing. This will enable Remotion to draw a volume curve in the timeline and is more performant.

:::note
When using the [`<Player>`](/docs/player), note that Mobile Safari [does not support the `volume` property](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/Using_HTML5_Audio_Video/Device-SpecificConsiderations/Device-SpecificConsiderations.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009523-CH5-SW11). The audio mix may not play as intended.
:::

## `muted` property

You may pass in the `muted` and it may change over time. When `muted` is true, audio will be omitted at that time. In the following example, we are muting the track between frame 40 and 60.

```tsx twoslash {8}
import { AbsoluteFill, Audio, staticFile, useCurrentFrame } from "remotion";

export const MyComposition = () => {
  const frame = useCurrentFrame();

  return (
    <AbsoluteFill>
      <Audio src={staticFile("audio.mp3")} muted={frame >= 40 && frame <= 60} />
    </AbsoluteFill>
  );
};
```

## Use audio from `<Video />` tags

Audio from [`<Video />`](/docs/video) and [`<OffthreadVideo />`](/docs/offthreadvideo) tags are also included in the output. You may use the [`startFrom`, `endAt`](/docs/video/#startfrom), [`volume`](/docs/video/#volume) and [`muted`](/docs/video/#muted) props in the same way.

## Controlling playback speed

<AvailableFrom v="2.2" />

You can use the `playbackRate` prop to control the speed of the audio. `1` is the default and means regular speed, `0.5` slows down the audio so it's twice as long and `2` speeds up the audio so it's twice as fast.

While Remotion doesn't limit the range of possible playback speeds, in development mode the [`HTMLMediaElement.playbackRate`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement/playbackRate) API is used which throws errors on extreme values. At the time of writing, Google Chrome throws an exception if the playback rate is below `0.0625` or above `16`.

## Audio visualization

You can obtain audio data and create visualizations based on it. See the page [Audio visualization](/docs/audio-visualization) for more info.

## Rendering audio only

Exporting as `mp3`, `aac` and `wav` is supported:

<Tabs
defaultValue="cli"
values={[
{ label: 'CLI', value: 'cli', },
{ label: 'renderMedia()', value: 'node', },
{ label: 'Lambda', value: 'lambda', },
]
}>
<TabItem value="cli">

To render only the audio via CLI, specify an extension when exporting via CLI:

```
npx remotion render src/index.ts my-comp out/audio.mp3
```

or use the `--codec` flag to automatically choose a good output file name:

```
npx remotion render src/index.ts my-comp --codec=mp3
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="node">

To render only the audio via Node.JS, use [`renderMedia()`](/docs/renderer/render-media) and set the [`codec`](/docs/renderer/render-media#codec) to an audio codec.

```tsx twoslash
// @module: ESNext
// @target: ESNext
import { bundle } from "@remotion/bundler";
import { getCompositions, renderMedia } from "@remotion/renderer"; // The composition you want to render
import path from "path";
const compositionId = "HelloWorld";

// You only have to do this once, you can reuse the bundle.
const entry = "./src/index";
console.log("Creating a Webpack bundle of the video");
const bundleLocation = await bundle(path.resolve(entry), () => undefined, {
  // If you have a Webpack override, make sure to add it here
  webpackOverride: (config) => config,
});

// Parametrize the video by passing arbitrary props to your component.
const inputProps = {
  foo: "bar",
};

// Extract all the compositions you have defined in your project
// from the webpack bundle.
const comps = await getCompositions(bundleLocation, {
  // You can pass custom input props that you can retrieve using getInputProps()
  // in the composition list. Use this if you want to dynamically set the duration or
  // dimensions of the video.
  inputProps,
});

// Select the composition you want to render.
const composition = comps.find((c) => c.id === compositionId);

// Ensure the composition exists
if (!composition) {
  throw new Error(`No composition with the ID ${compositionId} found.
  Review "${entry}" for the correct ID.`);
}
const outputLocation = `out/${compositionId}.mp4`;

// ---cut---
await renderMedia({
  composition,
  serveUrl: bundleLocation,
  codec: "mp3",
  outputLocation,
  inputProps,
});
```

  </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="lambda">

To render only the audio via Lambda, use [`renderMediaOnLambda()`](/docs/lambda/rendermediaonlambda) and set the [`codec`](/docs/lambda/rendermediaonlambda#codec) to an audio codec and [`imageFormat`](/docs/lambda/rendermediaonlambda#imageformat) to `none`.

```tsx twoslash
// @module: esnext
// @target: es2017
import { renderMediaOnLambda } from "@remotion/lambda";
// ---cut---

const { bucketName, renderId } = await renderMediaOnLambda({
  region: "us-east-1",
  functionName: "remotion-render-bds9aab",
  composition: "MyVideo",
  framesPerLambda: 20,
  serveUrl:
    "https://remotionlambda-qg35eyp1s1.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/sites/bf2jrbfkw",
  inputProps: {},
  codec: "mp3",
  imageFormat: "none",
  maxRetries: 1,
  privacy: "public",
});
```

To render via the Lambda CLI, use the [`npx remotion lambda render`](/docs/lambda/cli/render) command and pass the [`--codec`](/docs/lambda/cli/render#--codec) flag:

```
npx remotion lambda render --codec=mp3 https://remotionlambda-qg35eyp1s1.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/sites/bf2jrbfkw my-comp
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Order of operations<AvailableFrom v="4.0.141"/>

Before Remotion v4.0.141, it was not defined in which order audio operations would be applied and behavior in preview and render could deviate.

Since Remotion v4.0.141, the order of operations is guaranteed to be the following:

1. Trim audio (using [`startFrom`](/docs/audio#startfrom--endat)).
2. Offset audio (by putting it in a [sequence](/docs/terminology/sequence)).
3. Stretch audio (by adding a [`playbackRate`](/docs/audio#playbackrate)).

Example for a 30 FPS composition which is 60 frames long:

1. An [`<Audio>`](/docs/audio) tag has a [`startFrom`](/docs/audio#startfrom--endat) value of 45. The first 1.5 seconds of the audio get trimmed off.
2. The [`<Audio>`](/docs/audio) tag is in a [`<Sequence>`](/docs/sequence) which starts at `30`. The audio only begins playing at the 1.0 second timeline mark at the 1.5 second audio position.
3. The [`<Audio>`](/docs/audio) has a [`playbackRate`](/docs/audio#playbackrate) of `2`. The audio gets sped up by 2x, but the starting position and start offset is not affected.
4. The composition is 60 frames long, so the audio must stop at the 3.5 second mark:
   > (comp_duration - offset) \* playback_rate + start_from  
   > (60 - 30) \* 2 + 45 => frame 105 or the 3.5 second mark
5. Result: The section of 1.5sec - 3.5sec gets cut out of the audio and is played in the Remotion timeline between frames 30 and 59 at 2x speed.
