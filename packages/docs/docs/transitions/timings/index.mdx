A **timing** together with a presentation forms a transition.  
Remotion provides certain timings out of the box, but you can also [create your own](/docs/transitions/timings/custom).

## Available timings

import { Timings } from "../../../components/TableOfContents/transitions/timings";

<Timings />

## Getting the duration of a timing

You can get the duration of a transition by calling `getDurationInFrames()` on the timing:

```tsx twoslash title="Assuming a framerate of 30fps"
import { springTiming } from "@remotion/transitions";

springTiming({ config: { damping: 200 } }).getDurationInFrames({ fps: 30 }); // 23
```
