title: scalePath()
crumb: "@remotion/paths"
---

_Part of the [`@remotion/paths`](/docs/paths) package. Available from v3.3.43_

Allows you to grow or shrink the size of a path.

```tsx twoslash title="scale-path.ts"
import { scalePath } from "@remotion/paths";

const newPath = scalePath("M 0 0 L 100 100", 1, 2); // "M 0 0 L 100 200";
```

The origin of the transform is the top left corner of the path. To use a different origin, first use [`translatePath()`](/docs/paths/translate-path) to move the path to the desired origin, then scale it, and finally move it back to the original origin.

## Arguments

### `path`

_string_

A valid SVG Path string.

### `xScale`

_number_

The factor of which to scale the path horizontally. `1` will leave the path unchanged.

### `yScale`

_number_

The factor of which to scale the path vertically. `1` will leave the path unchanged.
