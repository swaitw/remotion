_Part of the [`@remotion/paths`](/docs/paths) package. Available from v3.3.40_

Returns the bounding box of the given path, suitable for calculating the `viewBox` value that you need to pass to an SVG.

The bounding box is the smallest rectangle which can contain the shape in full.

```tsx twoslash title="get-bounding-box.ts"
import { getBoundingBox } from "@remotion/paths";

const boundingBox = getBoundingBox(
  "M 35,50 a 25,25,0,1,1,50,0 a 25,25,0,1,1,-50,0"
);
// { x1: 35, x2: 85, y1: 24.999999999999993, y2: 75 };
```

This function will throw if the SVG path is invalid.

## Return type

Includes the following properties:

- `x1`: The leftmost x coordinate of the bounding box
- `x2`: The rightmost x coordinate of the bounding box
- `y1`: The topmost y coordinate of the bounding box
- `y2`: The bottommost y coordinate of the bounding box
- `width`: The width of the bounding box, _returned from v3.3.97_
- `height`: The height of the bounding box, _returned from v3.3.97_
- `viewBox`: The `viewBox` value that you can pass to an SVG, _returned from v3.3.97_

## `BoundingBox` type

In TypeScript, you can get the shape of the return value by importing the `BoundingBox` type:

```ts twoslash
import type { BoundingBox } from "@remotion/paths";
```
