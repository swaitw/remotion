title: reduceInstructions()
crumb: "@remotion/paths"
---

_Part of the [`@remotion/paths`](/docs/paths) package. Available from v3.3.40_

Takes an array of [`Instruction`](/docs/paths/parse-path)'s and reduces the amount of instruction types them so the path only consists of `M`, `L`, `C` and `Z` instructions.

:::note
In versions before v4.0.168, `Q` instructions were reduced away.
:::

In reverse logic, this function will eliminate all `H`, `V`, `S`, `T`, `A`, `Q` `m`, `l`, `h`, `v`, `c`, `s`, `q`, `t`, `a`, `q` and `z` instructions.

This is useful if you want to manually edit a path and want to make sure it's as simple as possible.

Note that this may result in a longer path.

```ts twoslash
import { reduceInstructions, ReducedInstruction } from "@remotion/paths";

const simplified: ReducedInstruction[] = reduceInstructions([
  { type: "m", dx: 10, dy: 10 },
  { type: "h", dx: 100 },
]);

/*
  [
    {type: 'M', x: 10, y: 10},
    {type: 'L', x: 110, y: 10},
  ]
*/
```

## `ReducedInstruction` type

If you want a type which includes only reduced instructions, you can import the `ReducedInstruction` type.

```ts twoslash
import { ReducedInstruction } from "@remotion/paths";
```
