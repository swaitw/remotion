_available since v4.0_

In order to use `ffmpeg` without having to directly install it, Remotion provides it via `npx remotion ffmpeg`.

Note that in order to keep the binary size small, the FFmpeg binary only understand the codecs that Remotion itself supports: H.264, H.265, VP8, VP9 and ProRes. A binary from the 7.1 release line of FFmpeg is used.

# Example

Convert a video file to an audio file

```bash
npx remotion ffmpeg -i input.mp4 output.mp3
```
