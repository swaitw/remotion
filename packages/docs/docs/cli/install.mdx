_removed in v4.0.0, available from v3.3_

_See ["No more FFmpeg installation"](/docs/4-0-migration#no-more-ffmpeg-install-ffmpegexecutable-option-removed)._  
This page is for archival purpose.

Ensures that `ffmpeg` or `ffprobe` are installed by downloading them from the internet if they cannot be found.

```bash
npx remotion install ffmpeg
```

```bash
npx remotion install ffprobe
```

You might not need to call this function. Remotion will automatically download `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` if a render is attempted, and no binary was found.

These commands are useful if you need `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` to be ready before the first render is started.
