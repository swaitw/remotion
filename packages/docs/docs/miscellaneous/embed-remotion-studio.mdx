We currently don't allow embedding the Remotion Studio as a React component into your own app. This is because:

<Step>1</Step> The desire to embed the Studio is usually tied to customizing the appearance or the behavior of the Studio. It is not currently designed to be customizable. <br/>

<Step>2</Step> The Studio is connected to a backend, it is not a frontend-only app. <br/><br/>

Consider the following alternatives:

## Use the Remotion Player

The Remotion Studio uses the [Remotion Player](/player) and builds a UI around it. You may use the Player yourself and create custom UI around it that aligns with your brand.

## Deploy the Remotion Studio

You can deploy the Remotion Studio to a long-running server in the cloud and make it accessible to your team. [Read here how to do so](/docs/studio/deploy-server).

## Wait for Remotion Bundles to include the Studio

If you are creating a [bundle](/docs/bundle), you will get a static folder that includes HTML, CSS and JavaScript files. Right now, if you open this folder in the browser or deploy it as a static site, you cannot preview the video. We plan to in the foreseeable future include the Remotion Studio in the bundle, so you can preview the video in the browser.
