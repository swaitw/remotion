title: Can Remotion be used for live streaming?
sidebar_label: Live streaming
---

Remotion is not designed for broadcasting. It's use case is to render fixed-length videos which content is deterministic from start to end.

Live streaming requires a different approach. Content is not known in advance, being able to react to events is often necessary, the video is not fixed-length and broadcasting is extremely performance sensitive, with all frames needing to be rendered in real-time.

Remotion declarative approach based on browser APIs is not suitable for this use case.

For streamers wanting to leverage web technologies in their livestream, we recommend that they build a web app with transparent background and add it as a browser source to [OBS](https://obsproject.com/).

You may create stinger transitions for OBS with Remotion, see an [example](https://github.com/JonnyBurger/ledevevent-stinger) here.

If you want to create live streams programmatically with React, we recommend [Live Compositor](https://compositor.live/) from our friends at [Software Mansion](https://swmansion.com/).
