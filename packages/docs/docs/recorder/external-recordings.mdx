You can also include recordings that you recorded externally in your Recorder video.  
For example, you may edit a vlog with it.

## Add files

Transfer the recordings from your camera to your computer and put them in the `public/<composition-id>` folder.  
The file structure should look like this:

```bash title="Assuming the composition id is 'vlog'"
public
├── vlog
│ ├── camera10.mov
│ ├── camera20.mov
│ └── camera30.mov

```

The prefix must be `"webcam"` for every video.  
The suffixes must be ascending in the order you want to use the videos.

## Generate captions

Run

```bash
bun sub.ts
```

to generate captions for your recordings.

## Use the videos

Now you can add more scenes in the right sidebar to start including the recordings.

## iPhone recordings

iPhone recordings are HEVC videos, which during rendering Chrome cannot get the dimensions of the video.  
You will get a render failure.

Here is a script to convert the recordings to MP4:

```ts title="convert.ts"
import { $ } from "bun";
import { renameSync, unlinkSync } from "fs";

const compositionId = "vlog";

const ls = (await $`ls public/${compositionId}`).stdout.toString("utf-8");
const files = ls.split("\n");

for (const file of files) {
  if (
    file.toLowerCase().endsWith(".mov") ||
    file.toLowerCase().endsWith(".mp4")
  ) {
    await $`bunx remotion ffmpeg -i public/${compositionId}/${file} public/${compositionId}/_${file}.mp4`;
    unlinkSync(`public/${compositionId}/${file}`);
    renameSync(
      `public/${compositionId}/_${file}.mp4`,
      `public/${compositionId}/${file.replace(/ /g, "_")}`,
    );
  }
}
```

Run it using

```sh
bun convert.ts
```

to fix the issue.

## Examples

In the [`our-recorder`](https://github.com/remotion-dev/our-recorder) repository, the compositions `marathon` and `airportrun` are using real-life footage.
