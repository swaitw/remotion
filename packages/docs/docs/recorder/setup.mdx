# Setup

First, [purchase](/docs/recorder/buy) the Recorder to [get access to the repo](https://github.com/remotion-dev/recorder).

## 1. Fork and clone

[Create a fork](https://github.com/remotion-dev/recorder/fork) of the `remotion-dev/recorder` repository.  
Clone the repository using `git clone` and `cd` into the directory.

:::note
You need to keep your fork **private** to not leak the source code of the Remotion Recorder.
:::

Then, clone your fork to get the project locally.

## 2. Install Bun

The Remotion Recorder requires [Bun](https://bun.sh/), with the minimum version being 1.1.11. To install it, run

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

## 3. Install dependencies

Once Bun is installed, run

```bash
bun i
```

to install all the neccessary dependencies.

## 4. Install Whisper.cpp

_optional_

This is a good time to initialize Whisper.cpp for captioning.  
This will install Whisper.cpp and download the model (the default being 1.5GB).

```
bun sub.ts
```

## 5. Run the Remotion Recorder

Once done, you are ready to start the Remotion Recorder:

```bash
bun start
```
