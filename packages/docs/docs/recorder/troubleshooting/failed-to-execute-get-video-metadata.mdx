If you get the following error while loading a composition:

```txt
Failed to execute getVideoMetadata(), Received a MediaError loading "/static-41edfae54cb6/welcome/webcam122.mp4". HTTP Status code of the file: 200. Check the path of the file and if it is a valid video.
```

It could be that the video file is still being re-encoded and FFmpeg is in the process of writing it.  
Wait until the process is finished and hard refresh the page to clear the cache (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac and Ctrl+Shift+R on Windows).
