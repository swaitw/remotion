If you get the following error while starting the Studio:

```
Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'decode')
  at new URLStateMachine
  at module.exports.basic
```

You are experiencing an issue with Bun after upgrading Remotion.  
You can resolve the issue by running

```
rm -rf node_modules
bun i
```

We are hoping to fix this issue soon.
