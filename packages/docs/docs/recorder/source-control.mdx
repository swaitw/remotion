By default the `public` folder is added to the `.gitignore` file. This means your recordings are not stored in Git.  
The videos are being kept locally and only changes to the code can be staged.

We set this as default because GitHub does not allow repositores bigger than 1GB and you may run into an error quickly.

## Enable Git LFS storage

:::note
We use Git LFS ourselves and recommend setting this up.
:::

If you want to add all your recordings to your repository, you can use Git LFS.

Your Git provider might charge you for storage.  
A GitHub account includes 1 GiB of free storage and 1 GiB a month of free bandwidth.  
[Afterwards, you can buy a 50GB data pack for $5](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-git-large-file-storage/upgrading-git-large-file-storage).

### 1. Track public folder

Comment the line in `.gitignore` that ignores the `public` folder:

```diff title="Comment out this line"
- public/**/*.{mp4,webm,mov}
+ # public/**/*.{mp4,webm,mov}
```

### 2. Setup Git LFS

1. [Download Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/).
2. Initialize Git LFS in your repository:

```bash
git lfs install
```

3. Configure Git LFS to track all .mp4 files located in the /public and all its subfolders:

```bash
git lfs track public/**/*.mp4
```

### 3. Commit and push

```bash
git add .gitattributes
git add public
git commit -m "Enable Git LFS"
git push
```
