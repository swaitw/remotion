To delete a recording, open the project in your file explorer and locate the recording in the `public` folder:

```
public
└── my-video
    ├── webcam10.mp4
    ├── display10.mp4
    ├── webcam20.mp4
    └── webcam30.mp4
```

Locate the recording that you want to remove and delete it.  
The Remotion Studio will automatically refresh and move all other recordings to the next available number.

To prevent the settings from the scenes cascading, delete the scene in the default props editor as well.
