You can also add recordings from other sources, like your phone.  
Simply name the file `webcam` followed by any number, like `10`, followed by one of the supported file extensions: `.mp4`, `.webm`, `.mkv` or `.mov`.

The order your recordings appear in your video is based on the number suffix.  
Here is a way you could structure your recordings:

```txt
public
└── my-video
    ├── webcam10.mp4
    ├── display10.mp4
    ├── webcam20.mp4
    └── webcam30.mp4
```

If there is only a `webcam` recording with said number, the webcam will be fullscreen.

A `display` recording will only get picked up if there is also a `webcam` recording.  
The webcam will be miniaturized in this case.

If you only have recorded a display, give it a `webcam` prefix nonetheless for it to get picked up.
