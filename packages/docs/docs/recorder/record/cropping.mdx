Sometimes you only want to record a portion of your screen.  
For example: You don't want the dock and menu bar of your Mac to be recorded.

The best way to achieve this is to create a virtual camera using [OBS](https://obsproject.com/).

<Step>1</Step> Download <a href="https://obsproject.com/">
  OBS from their website
</a> and install it.
<br />

<Step>2</Step> Open OBS and click on <kbd>Settings</kbd> -> <kbd>Video</kbd>.
Set as both the "Base Resolution" and Canvas Resolution the resolution of your
desired output. We recommend 1920x1080. Click on <kbd>OK</kbd>.
<br />
<Step>3</Step> Under <kbd>Sources</kbd>, add your display.
<br />
<Step>4</Step> Crop the video by dragging on the corners of the video.
<br />
<Step>5</Step> Click on <kbd>Start Virtual Camera</kbd>.<br />
<Step>6</Step> In the Remotion <a href="/docs/recorder/record/">
  Recording interface
</a>, you can now select "OBS Virtual Camera" as the source.
