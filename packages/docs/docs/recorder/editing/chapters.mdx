# Chapters

To add chapters, add a non-empty string in the `newChapter` input field of a scene which should mark the start of a new chapter.

For a video scene in `landscape` format consisting of a webcam recording and a screen recording, the chapter name will always be displayed.
In order to stop displaying the chapter name after a video scene, check the `stopChapteringAfterThis` checkbox.

In the `square` format, the chapter name is only displayed at the beginning of the scene where it is defined.
