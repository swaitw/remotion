Since the Recorder ships as source code and allows you to hack around with it, your version will diverge from our template, at least once we release an update.

## Pull updates

You may run

```
bun update.ts
```

to copy all files from our template into your version of the Recorder, except the `public`, `config` and `remotion/Root.tsx` folders.
This upgrades your local Remotion Recorder to the latest version.

If necessary, compare the changes that we have made the Recorder by visiting the following URL:

## Comparing changes

```
https://github.com/remotion-dev/recorder/compare/COMMIT_ID...main
```

Where `COMMIT_ID` is the commit at which you forked the Recorder.
