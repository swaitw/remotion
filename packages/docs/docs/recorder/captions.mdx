To generate captions, the Remotion Recorder uses [Whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) for fast and accurate transcriptions.
Each time you record a clip with the Remotion Recorder, captions are automatically generated and persisted to same folder as your recordings.

## Installing Whisper.cpp

The very first time you finish recording a clip, Whisper.cpp and a 1.5GB model will be installed on your computer. This may take a few minutes.
Once installed, captions for the `webcam` clip will be generated.

:::note
Captions are only generated for files with the `webcam` prefix.

## Make corrections

If the AI has made a mistake, no problem, there are various ways to correct the transcriptions manually. [See here how to do this](/docs/recorder/editing/captions).

## Generate captions via CLI

For [external recordings](/docs/recorder/external-recordings), you can also generate captions via the CLI.

```
bun sub.ts
```

Note that the names of the files you want to transcribe need to start with the prefix `webcam`, all other files will be ingored.
The JSON files containing the captions will be generated and saved under `public/<composition-id>/sub[timestamp].json`.

## Non-english languages

If you do not record in English, edit the `config/whisper.ts` file.

Set the language to a [supported value](/docs/install-whisper-cpp/transcribe#language) change change the `model` to a [supported value](/docs/install-whisper-cpp/download-whisper-model#model) that does not end in `.en`.  
It is advised to choose a larger model if you are transcribing in a non-english language.
