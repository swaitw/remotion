The Remotion codebase uses Prettier and ESLint for formatting and requires all code to be formatted correctly before it is merged.

## Prettier

In VS Code, you can install the [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode). Extensions for other editors are available on the [Prettier website](https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html).

The editor should automatically pick up our `.vscode/settings.json` file and format your code when you save a file.

To manually format a whole package, run `pnpm exec prettier src --write` on a package. Example:

```bash
cd packages/renderer
pnpm exec prettier src --write
```

## ESLint

ESLint will warn about code style issues and errors. You can install the [ESLint VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) extension to get warnings in the editor as you write code. Extensions for other editors are available on the [ESLint website](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/integrations).

You can also run `pnpm run lint` in any package to check if there are any errors. Example:

```bash
cd packages/renderer
pnpm run lint
```

## Testing everything

You can run

```bash
pnpm run stylecheck
```

in the root to test locally if the whole repo is well-formatted and will pass the continuous integration checks.
