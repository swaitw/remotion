The following error message:

```
The source provided ([...]) could not be parsed as a value list.
```

can happen when the wrong syntax is passed to the `FontFace` API.

Older versions on Chrome, including Chrome 104 which runs in Remotion Lambda does not support the FontFace syntax without quotes.

```txt title="❌ Without quotes"
src: url(font.woff2) format(woff2);
```

```txt title="✅ With quotes"
src: url('font.woff2') format('woff2');
```

To fix the issue, always include quotes.  
Use [`@remotion/fonts`](/docs/fonts-api) to use an abstraction that helps you avoid this mistake.
