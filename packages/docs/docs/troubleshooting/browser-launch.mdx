If you get an error message:

```
Failed to launch the browser process!

TROUBLESHOOTING: https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/main/docs/troubleshooting.md // or a URL pointing to this page
```

it means the browser was not able to start. The most common reasons are

## Missing shared libraries

Install the [missing shared libraries for your OS](/docs/miscellaneous/linux-dependencies).

## Wrong OS or architecture

If a x64 browser binary is run on arm64 or vice versa, you will get this error.  
If the browser was compiled for a different OS or Linux distribution, it might also be incompatible.
Make sure you are using the correct binary for your OS and architecture.

## Debug using `--log=verbose`

Add the `--log=verbose` flag to the `npx remotion render` command.  
This will log all browser process output, helping you to debug the issue.
