The following code is discouraged in Remotion:

```tsx title="❌ Don't do this"
import Image from "next/image";

const myMarkup = <Image src="https://picsum.photos/200/300"></Image>;
```

## Problem

Remotion has no way of knowing when the image is finished loading because it is impossible to determine so when loading an image through `<Image>`.

This will lead to Remotion not waiting for the image to be loaded during rendering and cause visible flickers.

## Solution

Use the [`<Img>`](/docs/img) tag instead:

```tsx twoslash title="✅ Do this"
const src = "abc";
// ---cut---
import { AbsoluteFill, Img } from "remotion";

const myMarkup = <Img src="https://picsum.photos/200/300" />;
```
