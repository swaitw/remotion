Deletes a deployed Cloud Run service based on its name.

To retrieve a list of services, call [`getServices()`](/docs/cloudrun/getservices) first.

## Example

```ts twoslash
// @module: esnext
// @target: es2017

import { deleteService, getServices } from "@remotion/cloudrun";

const services = await getServices({
  region: "us-east1",
  compatibleOnly: false,
});
for (const service of services) {
  await deleteService({
    region: "us-east1",
    serviceName: service.serviceName,
  });
}
```

## Arguments

An object with the following properties:

### `region`

The [GCP region](/docs/cloudrun/region-selection) to which the service was deployed to.

### `serviceName`

The name of the service to be deleted.

## Return value

Nothing. If the deletion failed, the service rejects with an error.
