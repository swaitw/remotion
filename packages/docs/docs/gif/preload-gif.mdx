crumb: "@remotion/gif"

_available from v3.3.38_

Call `preloadGif(src)` with the URL of the GIF that you would like to load and the GIF will be prepared for display in the [`<Player>`](/docs/player).

The function returns an object with two entries: `waitUntilDone()` that returns a Promise which can be awaited and `free()` which will cancel preloading or free up the memory if the GIF is not being used anymore.

```ts twoslash
import { preloadGif } from "@remotion/gif";

const { waitUntilDone, free } = preloadGif(
  "https://media.giphy.com/media/xT0GqH01ZyKwd3aT3G/giphy.gif"
);

waitUntilDone().then(() => {
  console.log("The GIF is now ready to play!");

  // Later, free the memory of the GIF
  free();
});
```
