The [Remotion Studio](/docs/studio) is the editor that opens that when you run [`npx remotion studio`](/docs/cli/studio).  
It allows for fast editing and playback of [compositions](/docs/terminology/composition).  
It is included in the [`@remotion/cli`](https://npmjs.org/packages/@remotion/cli) package.

Not to be confused with the [Remotion Player](/docs/player).

You can [deploy the Remotion Studio](/docs/studio/deploy-server) to render on a VPS.  
Since v4.0.93, the Studio is also embedded in every [Remotion Bundle](/docs/terminology/bundle), albeit it does not support rendering.

## Remotion Preview

The former name of the Remotion Studio, renamed in v4.0.0.  
Since the Preview gained more capabilities than just previewing, the name was not fitting anymore.
