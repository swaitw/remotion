The Remotion Root is the directory in which Remotion commands get executed in.  
It influences the default location of the [public dir](/docs/terminology/public-dir), the `.env` file and the [config file](/docs/config) amongst others.

## Which directory is the Remotion Root?

To determine the Remotion Root, take the directory from which you execute commands or run scripts, and go upwards until you hit a directory that contains a `package.json` file.  
Many Remotion CLI commands also print the Remotion Root directory if you pass `--log=verbose`.
