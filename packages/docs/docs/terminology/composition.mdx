A composition is something you can render. It consists of:

<Step>1</Step> a React component <br />
<Step>2</Step> the canvas width and height <br/>
<Step>3</Step> a "frames per second" (FPS) value <br/>
<Step>4</Step> a duration value<br/>
<Step>5</Step> an identifier <code>id</code><br/><br/>

It can be registered in the [Remotion Studio](/docs/terminology/studio) by rendering a [`<Composition>`](/docs/composition) component.  
A composition with a duration of 1 frame is also called a [`<Still>`](/docs/still).

In the [Remotion Player](/docs/terminology/player), you don't use the `<Composition>` component, rather you pass the component and metadata directly to the [`<Player>`](/docs/player/player).

Not to be confused with [`<Sequence>`](/docs/terminology/sequence).

## Composition ID

The string that you pass as the `id` prop to the [`<Composition>` component](/docs/composition).  
You need the composition ID to reference what you would like to render, for example: `npx remotion render src/index <composition-id>`.
