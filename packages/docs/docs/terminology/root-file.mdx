The Root file is the file that exports the Root component, which renders one or more [`<Composition />`](/docs/composition) components.  
By default, it is `src/Root.tsx` or `remotion/Root.tsx` in most Remotion templates, but you may reorganize the files arbitrarily.

The [entry point](/docs/terminology/entry-point) will import the Root file and register it with [`registerRoot()`](/docs/register-root)

See the [Root file of the Hello World project](https://github.com/remotion-dev/template-helloworld/blob/main/src/Root.tsx) as an example.
