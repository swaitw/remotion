[`<Sequence>`](/docs/sequence) is a built-in component in Remotion that:

- Absolutely positions content
- Allows you to time-shift elements

Think of it as the equivalent of a "layer" in After Effects or Photoshop.  
Not to be confused with [`<Composition>`](/docs/terminology/composition).

## Layouting

A [`<Sequence>`](/docs/sequence) by default will also be absolutely positioned in the DOM, so you can use it to overlay elements on top of each other.

## Time-shifting

Consider an element which starts animating at frame 0.  
If you would like to delay the animation, rather than refactoring the animation, you can wrap it in a `<Sequence>` and define a delay using the [`from`](/docs/sequence#from) prop.

Using a sequence, you can also trim the start and end of an animation by passing the [`durationInFrames`](/docs/sequence#durationinframes) prop.
