_Available from v2.1.2._

Remotion supports environment variables being passed directly from the CLI, using a `.env` file and from the [`renderMedia()`](/docs/renderer/render-media) function.

## Passing variables from the CLI

If you want to pass an environment variable from the CLI, you need to prefix it with `REMOTION_`. This is a security feature to prevent your whole environment (which could contain sensitive information) being included in a Webpack bundle.

You can pass environment variables in development mode and while rendering. For example:

```bash
REMOTION_MY_VAR=hello_world npm run dev
```

In your project, you can access the variable using `process.env.REMOTION_MY_VAR`.

## Using a dotenv file

[Dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) support is built in if you use the CLI.  
If you use the Node.JS APIs, the `.env` file **is not automatically read** and you need to use the `dotenv` package yourself.

Place a `.env` file in the [root](/docs/terminology/remotion-root) of your project and fill it with key-value pairs.

```ini title=".env"
MY_VAR=hello
ANOTHER_VAR=world
```

In your Remotion frontend code you can read `process.env` to get an object of environment variables: `{"MY_VAR": "hello", "ANOTHER_VAR": "world"}`.

Since `v4.0.110`, the following locations will get automatically recognized:

- `.env` in your [Remotion Root](/docs/terminology/remotion-root)
- `.env.local` in your [Remotion Root](/docs/terminology/remotion-root)

You can see which config file gets read by adding a `--log=verbose` flag to your command and looking out for the following log:

```
Loaded env file from /Users/my-user/remotion-project/.env.local.
```

You can override the location of your dotenv file using the [configuration file setting](/docs/config#setdotenvlocation) or the [CLI flag](/docs/cli).

## Using in Node.js APIs

When using the [Node.js APIs](/docs/renderer) such as [`renderMedia()`](/docs/renderer/render-media) or [`renderMediaOnLambda()`](/docs/lambda/rendermediaonlambda), the environment variables are **not** picked up automatically.

The reason is that one might integrate Remotion as a small part of a big application and if Remotion would read the `.env` file automatically and forward all variables to renders, it would lead to a security issue.

To pass environment variables while server-side-rendering, pass an object to the [`envVariables` option of `renderMedia()`](/docs/renderer/render-media#envvariables).

If you want to read the environment variables from a `.env` file, use the [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) package.

## The `envVariables` option

The `envVariables` option of [`renderMedia()`](/docs/renderer/render-media#envvariables), [`renderMediaOnLambda`](/docs/lambda/rendermediaonlambda) accepts an object of key-value pairs.  
These values can then be read from `process.env` inside your React component.

The option is not for authenticating with AWS - instead, load the AWS credentials using one of the described methods above.
