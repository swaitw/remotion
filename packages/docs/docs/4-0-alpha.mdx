Remotion 4.0 has now been released. This page has been archived.

Thanks for testing and reporting bugs! ðŸŽ‰

## How to upgrade

See the [changelog](#changelog) to find the latest version.
Upgrade `remotion` and all packages starting with `@remotion` to the latest version, e.g. `4.0.0`:

```diff title="package.json"
- "remotion": "^3.3.87"
- "@remotion/bundler": "^3.3.87"
- "@remotion/eslint-config": "^3.3.87"
- "@remotion/eslint-plugin": "^3.3.87"
- "@remotion/cli": "^3.3.87"
- "@remotion/renderer": "^3.3.87"
+ "remotion": "4.0.0-alpha13"
+ "@remotion/bundler": "4.0.0-alpha13"
+ "@remotion/eslint-config": "4.0.0-alpha13"
+ "@remotion/eslint-plugin": "4.0.0-alpha13"
+ "@remotion/cli": "4.0.0-alpha13"
+ "@remotion/renderer": "4.0.0-alpha13"
```

Make sure the versions don't have a `^` character in front of it.

Most important breaking changes:

<Step>1</Step> The config file must now import the config like the following:<br/>

```ts
import { Config } from "@remotion/cli/config";
```

<Step>2</Step> Also in the config file:<br/>

```ts
Config.setImageFormat("jpeg");
```

has been replaced with

```ts
Config.setVideoImageFormat("jpeg");
```
