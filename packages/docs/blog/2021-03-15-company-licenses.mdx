We got rid of the "Contact us for pricing" policy and have announced the pricing for Remotion publicly. Head over to [companies.remotion.dev](https://companies.remotion.dev) to see it!

This is a new platform where you can directly buy a Remotion license, get invoices, upgrade/downgrade or cancel without having to get in touch with us.

Needless to say, you can still [email us](mailto:hi@remotion.dev) if you like a consultation!
