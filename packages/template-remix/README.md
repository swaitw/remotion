This is a [Remix starter kit](https://remix.run/docs) with [Remotion](https://remotion.dev), [`@remotion/player`](https://remotion.dev/player) and [`@remotion/lambda`](https://remotion.dev/lambda) built in.  
It lets you render a video from a Remix app with AWS Lambda.

Here is the output video:

## Getting started

Install dependencies using

<!-- create-video will replace this with the package manager specific command -->

```
npm install
```

## Run the Remix app

Run the example app using:

```
npm run dev
```

## Edit the video

Start the Remotion Preview (the editor interface) using:

```
npm run remotion:studio
```

## Render videos with AWS Lambda

Follow these steps to set up video rendering:

1. Follow the steps in [Remotion Lambda setup guide](https://www.remotion.dev/docs/lambda/setup).
2. Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env`.
3. Fill in the `REMOTION_AWS_REGION` with the region that you would like to use, e.g. `us-east-1`.
4. Fill in the `REMOTION_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `REMOTION_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` values that you got from the first step.

5. Run the following to deploy your Lambda function and Remotion site:

```
npm run remotion:deploy
```

> Rerun this command whenever you have upgraded to a new Remotion version.

6. Restart the Remix server.

## Commands

Start the app in development mode:

```
npm run dev
```

Build the app for production:

```
npm run build
```

Start the app in production mode (after build is done):

```
npm run dev
```

Start the Remotion preview:

```
npm run remotion:preview
```

Render the example video locally:

```
npx remotion render
```

Upgrade all Remotion packages:

```
npx remotion upgrade
```

Render the example video on AWS Lambda:

```
npm run remotion:renderlambda
```

Deploy/Update the Remotion video on S3 and the Lambda function:

```

## Upgrading Remotion

When upgrading Remotion to a newer version, you will need to redeploy your function and update your site using the commands above.  
If your functions or sites are already used in production, make sure to not overwrite them - [read here](https://www.remotion.dev/docs/lambda/upgrading) for more details about upgrading.
